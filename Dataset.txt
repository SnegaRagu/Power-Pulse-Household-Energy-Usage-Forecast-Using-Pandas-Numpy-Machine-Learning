Dataset Definitions:

	1. Global_active_power (kW) 

    	* real power consumed by the household
    	
    		P=V×I×cosφ 
        where V = voltage, I = current, cosφ\cos\varphicosφ = power factor (PF per phase)

	2. Global_reactive_power (kvar)

	    * power that oscillates between source and load due to inductive (motors) or capacitive (electronics) effects.
      * affects current flow so lower efficiency
	
		    Q=V×I×sinφ
		    where V = voltage, I = current, sinφ\sin\varphisinφ = power factor (PF per phase)

	3. Voltage (V)

      * pressure driving current through the household wiring
      * Fluctuations affect appliance performance (low V → dim lights; high V → possible damage)

	4. Global_intensity (A)

      * average current drawn by household
	
	5. Sub_metering_1 (wh)

      * power consumed by kitchen (microwave, dishwasher, oven)

	6. Sub_metering_2 (wh)

      * power consumed by laundry room (washing machine, tumble-drier, refrigerator, light)
	
	7. Sub_metering_3 (wh)

      * power consumed by water heater and air conditioner
	
	8. Global_energy_consumption (wh)

      * energy consumed in a household per minute
	
    		Energy (global_per_hour) = Power global * Time per_hour 
    		Energy (global_per_min) = (global_active_power * 1000/60) (wh)
	
	9. Global_sub_metered_energy (wh)

      * measured by metered individual power
	
		    Energy (Global_sub_metered) = sub_metering_1 + sub_metering_2 + sub_metering_3
	
	10. Global_unmetered_energy (wh)

      * unmetered household power
	
		    E (unmetered)  = E (global) + E (Global_sub_metered)
