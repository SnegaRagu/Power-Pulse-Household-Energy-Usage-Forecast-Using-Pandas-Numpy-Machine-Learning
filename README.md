**Introduction**

Powerpulse project aims to develop machine learning regression models to predict the power consumption using historical labelled data. With this model, consumer can understand energy usage patterns while providers can forecast demand.â€‹ It is a predictive model that helps better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources.

**Problem Statement**

In the modern world, energy management is a critical issue for both households and energy providers. Predicting energy consumption accurately enables better planning, cost reduction, and optimization of resources. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict household energy consumption based on historical data. Using this model, consumers can gain insights into their usage patterns, while energy providers can forecast demand more effectively.
By the end of this project, learners should provide actionable insights into energy usage trends and deliver a predictive model that can help optimize energy consumption for households or serve as a baseline for further research into energy management systems.

**Project Workflow**

1. Data Understanding and Exploration:

  * Load and explore the dataset for structure and quality.
  * Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
    
2. Data Preprocessing:

  * Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
  * Parse date and time into separate features.
  * Normalize and scale the data for better performance.

3. Feature Engineering:

  * Extract relevant features like daily averages, peak hours, and rolling averages.
  * Integrate external data, such as weather conditions, if available.
  
4. Model Development:

  * Train regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
  * Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
    
5. Evaluation and Insights:

  * Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.
  * Visualize energy trends and feature importance.
